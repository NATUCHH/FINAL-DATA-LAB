<H2> About me </H2>
   
    <a id="aboutme"></a>

        <p style="line-height:200% "> I’m a 20 years old passionate of art and design that developed my curiosity at an early age, so I’ve dedicated my life to it.

        <br> Currently, I’m at my third year as a student of design at the Torcuato Ditella University in Buenos Aires, Argentina. I’m working as the community manager of my family’s clothing business. As a multiple designer, my skills include disciplines such as graphic, digital and industrial design. 
            
        <br> I consider it important to have a comprehensive look at Design, thats why in the last 3 years i’ve been adding skills to be able to translate my work intodiferent media.</p>
